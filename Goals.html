    <h3>These are a Few of My Goals</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Build A Car</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Not a toy one, not even a real fuel car, I wanna build
                    an Edison, in the honor of <strong><a href="https://www.thomasedison.com/">Sir Thomas Edison</a></strong>
                </li>
                <li>It is gonna be a flying car, which runs on little amount of
                    pollutants present in the air.
                </li>
                <li>Yup, you might ask, the world is very very polluted, to that I 
                    answer, well, I am gonna go to Uranus you idiot.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Which brings me to : I wanna go to <a href="https://www.uranus.io/">Uranus</a></strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Not much to explain here, just wanna go to Uranus,
                    you know if you know.
                </li>
                <li>I mean I could settle with some nearby planets, but I predict that
                    in the near future there is gonna be a <strong><a href="https://www.oneplus.com/">Basic Math Academy</a></strong> who's 
                    motto will be "Never Settle" so why should I settle.
